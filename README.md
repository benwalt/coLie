This project contains Python / Sage code for working with Lie coalgebras and algebras.  

Code is present both as python .py files and as jupyter notebook .ipynb files.
The jupyter notebooks give explanations and small examples using included objects 
and functions to make computations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the algebra-coalgebra algorithms present were first coded as javascript 
(see included pairing.html file).  The letter braiding algorithm and structure of 
bch computation for group relations is originally due to Aydin Ozbek
 -  https://github.com/AydinOzbek/Hopf_Invariants

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These algorithms are based off of theory present in:
