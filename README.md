This code is dedicated to the memory of Aydin Ozbek.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains Python / Sage code for working with Lie coalgebras and algebras.  

Code is present both as python .py files and as jupyter notebook .ipynb files.
The jupyter notebooks give explanations and small examples using included objects 
and functions to make computations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the algebra-coalgebra algorithms present were first coded by me in javascript 
(see included pairing.html file from 2015).  

The letter braiding computations in EilWord and EilTree are based off work by Aydin Ozbek 
 -  https://github.com/AydinOzbek/Hopf_Invariants

The Lyndon word generation algorithm I use is based off of C code by Joe Sawada 
 -   http://combos.org/necklace
